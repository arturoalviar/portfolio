### What I do when I am not coding

When I have free time and feel like relaxing, I love to watch [anime](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/SoS_9797)(my totally legit way to practice my Japanese).

I grew up playing Nintendo games and even now, I love playing my Switch â€” specifically Splatoon 2. I got into PC gaming after discovering how insanely cheap PC games are during a Steam summer sale. I built my first PC after graduating college and since then, I have built a number of PCs (three for myself and three for some friends). While I have a ginormous library of games from Steam, Origin, uPlay, and the Epic Games store , I mainly play [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/elguey-11560) on PC (like, a lot).
