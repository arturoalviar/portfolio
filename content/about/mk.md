### My weird hobby of collecting plastic and metal

A couple years ago, I bought a mechanical keyboard and fell into this bizarre hobby of [mechanical keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/). My main attraction to the hobby is the ability to customize a keyboard that feels satisfying to type on and looks great on my desk. I own and have built a couple of keyboards but my main keeb for now is the [RAMA m60-a](https://rama.works/#/m60-a/), with lubed holy pandas and [GMK Serika keycaps](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-x-zambumon-gmk-serika-custom-keycap-set?mode=guest_open).
