### A short intro

My journey as a web developer began when I took an information visualization course that centered around displaying data on the web using d3.js. After graduating from Middlebury College in 2015 with a B.A. in Computer Science, I completed an internship for BentPixels where I worked as a Product Mangager & UX/UI Designer.

Afterwards, I worked as a front end developer at a design agency called [VDS](http://vdsla.com/) in Long Beach, CA. During my time there, I also worked remotely as a freelance web developer on several projects for [Monumental Design](http://thisismonumental.com/).
