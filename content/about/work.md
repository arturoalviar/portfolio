### Always adding to the stack

Every new project starts with opening [Atom](https://atom.io/) and initiating a package.json file via [Hyper.js](https://hyper.is/). I am well-versed in HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. If I need to use preprocessors, Pug is my go-to for HTML, Stylus for CSS, and Babel for es6. I love building stuff with React and Vue. I backup my work using git and store most of my projects on [Github](https://github.com/arturoalviar).
