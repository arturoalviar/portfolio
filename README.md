Redesigned my portfolio using GatsbyJS

## Features/Stack

- React Hooks
- React Pose for transitions
- Styled components with styled theming
- Remark and JSON for content
- PWA
- Offline support

## TODO

- Use a headless CMS like prismic.io and phase out Remark + JSON
- Host on Zeit or Netlify (after domain transfer)
