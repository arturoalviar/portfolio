### Ditching jQuery & buildling with ES6

During this project, I developed a couple of custom plugins in order to meet the requirements that Michael had on the site. Since I wanted this site to be jQuery free, I rewrote the bootstrap carousel plugin using ES6. In addition, I created a lightweight parallax and scroll reveal plugin. This was my third project using Barba.js which allowed for smooth page transitions and faster load times.
