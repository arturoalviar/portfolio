### Why not turn a one-key keyboard into a Philips Hue switch?

I came up with the idea for vhue (vue + hue) because I wanted to use a [big switch](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/bigseries) as a remote control for my Phillips Hue lights.

I have always wanted to build a desktop application with Electron, and after taking a couple of [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com) courses, I decided to build this app with Electron.js and Vue.
