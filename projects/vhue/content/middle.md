### Committing every day

I used the [electron-vue boilerplate](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue) since it did a lot of the heavy lifting such as providing hot reloading, a file that generates my Vuex store on the fly.

##### API calls made simple with axios

Initially, I planned to use the node-hue-api package, but it lacked some essential API calls so I decided to create my own methods using axios. Honestly, the axios approach ended up being the right _call_ (get it?) since I designed my API calls in a specific way and had complete exposure to the response data.

##### Vue + Vuex

Coming from React and understanding the notion of reactivity made writing Vue fairly simple. While easy to learn, I did hit some bumps in the road when writing Vue components but most of those issues were resolved when I read the Vue API docs. One particular issue I had was in the light component, a card that gives a simple overview of a particular Hue light. I initially had a watcher updating the light but after reading the docs, I realized the watcher method was redundant and there was a bug in my file that made an API call after setting up the Hue bridge.

Vuex made it easy to store essential data like the userâ€™s Hue API token and with the use of electron vuex, which is just an electron store wrapper, the Vuex store persisted even after quitting the app. In addition, I stored all the response data from the Hue API calls in order for the Vue components to update via store getters.

##### Electron

I used the Electron API to create a method to reset the Vuex store and add a global shortcut. With the global shortcut, a user can toggle a group of lights, even when the app is not focused; this global shortcut was the key to making my big switch act as a dimmer switch for my lights.
