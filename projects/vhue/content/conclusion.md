### Thank you USPS

An app comes about because you want to do something in a particular way and with vhue, I created a rather elaborate solution to turn on my Phillips Hue lights. While there are more features that I can add, some which I plan to add, I can say that vhue 1.0 was a great way to cement the fundamentals of Vue and Vuex.

Also, this came about not only because I wanted to use my big switch as a switch but because USPS delivered my Philips Hue switch to the wrong house.
