### Harnessing the power of CSS3 & ES6

One of the cool things about this site is the smooth SVG and CSS3 animations. The form on the site was handled using axios. Error validation was implemented using the power of HTML5 and CSS3 pseudo styles.

Another neat thing was working with css blend modes. Since blend modes were not supported in Microsoft Edge, I wrote some code to polyfill the effect.
