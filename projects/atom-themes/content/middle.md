### Being inspired by the keycaps I type on

I am a mechanical keyboard enthusiast and it is primary due to the amazing looking keycap sets. All my syntax themes were influenced directly by a specific keycap set. In addition to the themes, I decided to create a UI theme called Kecleon (named after the Pokemon and inspired by the Material UI theme) in order to enjoy the syntax themes to their fullest.
